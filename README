Credit must go to where and whome it is due:
a) Stepper Implimentation code half uses ideas from...
    ==================================================
    astepper lib

    = Ideas taken from grbl code written by          =
    = Simen Svale Skogsrud / Sungeun K. Jeon         =
    ==================================================
b) Stepper Acceleration and Deceleration profile
   was taken from Appnote AVR446 which impliments very 
   efficiently on this micro
  ====================================================
c) The pic32mz is setup to run at 200mhz with all its 
   pbclk's set at various frequencies.
   ===================================================
d) The steps and pulses are driven from master timers 
   associated with the Output compare modules, 
   the code impliments 6 axis output compare with
   2 axis control at present moment. 
   the stepper controls are therefore asychrinous due 
   to this implimentation, the relevant timers can
   run very fast, although setup for 1:8 prescalar 
   with a 50mhz master pbclk
   ==================================================
e) Bresenhams alog is used for interpolation and grbls
   matrix circle will be used, some of grbl's ideas 
   are used here but the cotrol is quite different as it 
   uses a form of nco using the OCx module.
