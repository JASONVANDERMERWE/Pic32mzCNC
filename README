Credit must go to where and whome it is due:
a) Stepper Implimentation code half uses ideas from...

    = http://davidegironi.blogspot.it/               =
    = Ideas taken from grbl code written by          =
    = Simen Svale Skogsrud / Sungeun K. Jeon         =
    ==================================================
b) Stepper Acceleration and Deceleration profile
   was taken from Appnote AVR446 which impliments very 
   efficiently on this micro
  ====================================================
c) The pic32mz is setup to run at 200mhz with all its 
   pbclk's set at various frequencies.
   ===================================================
d) The steps and pulses are driven from master timers 
   associated with the Output compare modules, 
   the code impliments 6 axis output compare with
   2 axis control at present moment. 
   the stepper controls are therefore asynchronous due 
   to this implimentation, the relevant timers can
   run very fast, although setup for 1:8 prescalar 
   with a 50mhz master pbclk
   ==================================================
e) Bresenhams alog is used for interpolation and grbls
   matrix circle will be used, NO while loops and for loops
   are implimented during Interpolation of stepper moves
   this is due to the nature of the output compare modules.
   The steppers are very smooth and the pulses can clock
   very fast without any overhead.

Pulse,train control with Trapizodial acc/dec
==================================================
A cnc type control using CIP with pic32mz2048efh          
==================================================


This library drives up to 6 stepper motors using the various Pololu drivers

It uses the Outout capture compares and Timers running in the backgroung freeing up
core to do other tasks, changing OCRx registers results in the change of the interrupt 
frequency, which is how the acc and dec is achieved

Notes
-----------
Code was developed with MikroC Pro for Pic32, it will eventually be a complete code to
use with Clicker2 for pic32mz.
There will be a Shield designed for the Clicker2.
